## Overview of Insights

Once your file is processed, EXL Transaction Insights automatically analyses and enriches each transaction using its proprietary AI models and metadata layer. The output provides a holistic view of financial activity across several analytical dimensions:

### Derived Insights & Metrics 
- **Cash Flow Summary**: Total inflows, outflows, and net surplus over the evaluation period.
- **Income Stability**: Variance and consistency of income sources across months .
- **Expense Distribution**: Categorized spend patterns and concentration of top expense types.
- **Debt & Liability Indicators**: Loan repayments, credit card payments, overdraft usage.
- **Asset & Investment Signals**: Presence of investment-related transactions (e.g., mutual funds, insurance, deposits).

### Behavioral Indicators

- Detection of **early warning triggers**, such as declining balances or increased overdraft usage.
- Identification of **cash-intensive behaviour or irregular income inflows**.
- Assessment of **financial discipline indicators**, such as regular savings or consistent repayments.

### Visualization & Reporting
- The output is displayed through intuitive **dashboards and charts**, highlighting monthly trends, ratios, and behavioural scores.
- Users can toggle between **summary** and **detailed transaction views**, or export results as downloadable reports for further analysis.

The insights generated during the trial are limited in scope and are only indicative of the full capabilities available in the production environment, which will be accessible upon entering into a contract for a POC or production deployment.
