## Trial Data Handling Policy

- The free trial operates in a sandboxed environment completely isolated from production systems.
- Uploaded datasets are stored temporarily and automatically deleted after the session ends.
- No uploaded data is used for training, testing, or improvement of the models.
- Data is not shared with any third party.
EXL ensures that even in the evaluation environment, your organization’s data remains confidential, compliant, and protected under the same governance standards as production-grade deployments.
